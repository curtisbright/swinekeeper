0.1.0
 - Bugfix: The first field uncovered is now never a bomb 
   (MS Minesweeper shows the same behavior)
 - it is now possible to terminate the solver algorithm using the 'esc' 
   key. This is useful, since in some cases, the algorithm needs 
   rather long to compute a solution. Further, the smilie icon changes
   while the solution is computed. - Currently available only in WTL version. 
   (thanks to Geofrey Sanders for suggestions regarding the last two points) 
 - it is now possible to invoke the solver algorithm when the game is lost 
   (before it was only possible during the game) 
 - simple History mechanism now available in both versions 
0.1.1
 - Bugfix: Clicking the Smilie (reset game) sometimes caused a crash 
   Reason: see CDocHistory::rememberDoc() 
0.1.2 
 - compiles now with Qt under Windows & Linux
